## Introduction

This document describes the architecture of the **Student Enrollment System**, designed to manage the process of student course registration, unenrollment, class material access, and course establishment.

The system will assist developers in understanding its architecture and stakeholders in visualizing how the processes are structured.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of the **Student Enrollment System** is to:
- Provide a seamless way for students to enroll in, view, or drop courses.
- Allow access to course materials, including lecture recordings, assignments, and notes.
- Log and audit all operations for compliance and system traceability.
- Ensure data consistency across course metadata, enrollment history, and student profiles.
